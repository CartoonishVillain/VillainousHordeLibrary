# VillainousHordeLibrary
 A library for folks who want to include Raid-like events!

 This library is work in progress! Feel free to contribute! Please try to stay within the spec guidelines <Link here>.
 Going too far out of spec or out of the spirit of the library may result in a denied PR.

 The goal of this project is to enable easier creation of events like raids within Minecraft.
 This should provide the basic starting point for a prospective mod creator to make their own raid events.
 While also being flexible, allowing for overrides to put fine details into certain things (such as special conditions for what spawns where).

  Usage (No known installation method at this time)
  It would be preferred if you made the CurseForge project a dependency as you base your code off of the horde system.
  This however is not absolutely required. You are free to copy and paste code while following the license.

  By contributing to this repository you agree to have your code under the license found in the file LICENSE.
